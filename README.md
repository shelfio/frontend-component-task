# Component

Estimated task time **4h.** (possibly more or less). Please commit gradually to see progress of task completion.
Please use React (in away you want), CSS/SCSS/less/Styled components does not matter

Main objective:

![role](materials/role-module.png)

Make component with UI shown above. Inside dropdown should have:

- Dropdown predefined values (User, Member, Admin) + "Custom" role
- Changed predefined values(User, Member, Admin) in dropdown will update state of checkboxes to different values
  - All predefined roles will have no possibility(read-only) to change values of checkboxes
- Selecting "Custom" role will allow to set any positions of checkboxes
  - Default state: all checkboxes unchecked

Role examples:

- Admin - all checkboxes enabled
- User - can't move/delete gems and folders
- Member - can only view and share gems and folders

Goals:

- [ ] Make checkboxes(images inside [materials folder](/materials)) and dropdowns components (without native select, checkbox and without UI Frameworks)
- [ ] Callback on changing user role(dropdown) will return current role and checkbox state
- [ ] On save invoke callback with current value with role and checkbox states

Bonus points:

- [ ] Simple responsive (not over the head but not broken)
- [ ] Component covered with unit/integration tests
- [ ] Readable and understandable types(TS)
- [ ] Dev docs - how to use component (as it like npm module)
- [ ] Build - script to minified lib version
- [ ] Crossbrowser prefixed styles + polyfills (production readiness + IE11)
